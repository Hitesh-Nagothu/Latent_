JOB 5. Learn Django (creating light websites), where the platform input would be like: Saturday 10 PM
Search: Pandemic elections 2020, date_from, date_to, country etc etc.
the above search goes as an url request to solr instance and fetches the output (as we have done in Project 3). This output should be shown in a representative format on the UI page
Disclaimer: Requirement 3 of the course, can be fulfilled once we have above ready as a prototype
